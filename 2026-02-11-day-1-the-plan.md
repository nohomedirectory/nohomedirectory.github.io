Last night I slept in the woods. It was 30 degrees. Today I'm at the library with a laptop, some donated Claude Code passes, and 12 hours to start building.

## The Project

I'm building a clean-room, memory-safe PDF renderer and generator in Rust. Every major PDF library in the world today is either written in C/C++ with decades of security vulnerabilities, or it's painfully slow. There's no fast, safe, modern alternative.

I've never written a line of Rust.

## Why That Doesn't Matter

I don't write code line by line anymore. I direct AI coding agents — primarily Claude Code — using detailed architectural specifications. My job is to be the architect: understand the problem space, design the system, write the spec, and steer the agents.

## What I Did Today

## What I Learned

*This is post #1 of an ongoing series. I'll be writing daily about what I build, what works, what doesn't, and what it's like to do this from a library with nothing.*
