## A Good Start

For day 2, I began my day by a kind soul saying they'd pay for my brakes to be fixed on the car. I thought the car would maybe be towed, and it wasn't drivable (safely). That was at 7am. The library's hours were 9am to 9pm. So, after dropping the car off, I actually went to a nearby church that was open (opened at 830am, went there before the library) to see if they'd be willing to let me do some work there. I figured I'd potentially be in a better environment to focus. They said no, so, I headed on over to the library.

I filmed this video in the church parking lot after told it wasn't open to the public:

## The Work

There, I continued mapping out my problem space. I gathered up a bunch of context from [@doodlestein](https://x.com/doodlestein) on x.com. I settled on using the built in Grok, expert mode, with the prompt (and slight variations):

> "Hello there. I'd like you to gather for me a bunch of information from @doodlestein user here on x. I am specifically interested in the planning process, beads conversion from a plan/spec, and project structure. Here is the following I currently have in a GDoc: "ORIGINAL PARAGRAPH (not from Jeffrey):
> A clean-room PDF renderer/generator. PDF is the de facto document interchange format, and the existing implementations (Poppler, MuPDF, the various Java/Python libraries) are all either C/C++ with decades of CVEs or painfully slow. A correct, memory-safe, fast PDF engine would be used everywhere from browsers to enterprise document pipelines.

> ADVICE FROM JEFFREY:
> Show Claude my spec for frankentui and tell it to make one like it for pdf. Get a complete open source pdf renderer/generator in typescript as reference
> Make it in rust
> —
> Now, my goal: Create the world's best and most performant, memory-safe Rust PDF Ren./Gen. A blog post will be created for it: "How I took a bunch of donated Claude passes and turned it into the world's best and most performant, memory-safe Rust PDF renderer and generator"
> Importantly, utilizing AI Agents in the entire ideation, planning, implementation, testing, etc. progress will be paramount. I, the human, essentially will act as a thought partner with the ideation, and then an orchestrator with planning, and a very distant manager during the implementation/testing - for impl/test, the coding system itself will be catered to a closed-loop style, the idea is for me, the human, to not be a bottleneck on the AI Agent productivity - but, that will come later on after the ideation/planning phase. It's important to consider the new agent capabilities that are at our disposal: this project is indeed very ambitious, but the goal here is to show just what is possible with the new AI coding agents, and astonishingly, at such a fast rate, by a literal homeless man in a public library, taking only days to produce (Yes, this is ENTIRELY realistic)." But, first, let's understand the need for this new Rust implementation of a pdf ren/gen, and how such  a robust implementation can be had given the new agentic capabilities. This will also be used to tie in somewhere for the blog portion - So, I can actually also start literally writing the blog post as well - I have another tab open in the GDoc called "Blog Post" Like I said, we need to emphasize his 'talkings' on planning, repo initialization/structure, conversion of some 'plan' (file or multiple files - and, I know I'd use automated reviewer pro in the process given the complexity), and then also hearing his process on the beads conversion process. These are great resources https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2014182649955266882 Planning related X posts:https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2007588870662107197?s=20https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2008813776687030781?s=20https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2008683457715548549?s=20https://x.com/doodlestein/status/2004650413484658735?s=20https://x.com/doodlestein/status/1997777154612797787?s=20 I would like you to return a file that contains the relevant information that I can use. I want you to get every single prompt he posted, verbatim, and annotate how I could utilize them."

I got about 5 of those badboys out, then sent it into gpt5.2 pro to consolidate them into a single file, but then did a few 'critique rounds' on it with the hope to make the information more useful.

## The Car

I eventually picked my car up, and that was fantastic - I truly felt such a large amount of hype. Having this functional car back has opened a lot of opportunities to me now.

I went to another bigger, quiet library to finish out the day (up to 9pm).

## After Hours

Then drove tried to get into an ihop and a dennys for their free wifi to continue work a bit longer, but they were both closed (ihop was takeout only 24/7, and the dennys was going on with maintenance). I began driving to another, but figured it was better to get sleep at that point and get after it tomorrow. It may have been a situation where I'm just staring at the screen in a haze. Also, I would have gotten something cheap for like $2 so I wouldn't be loitering.

I also did gpt 5.2 deep research on finding me options around my city, which is what even gave me the 24/7 diner ideas to be able to continue my work.

Anyways, found a parking lot (I was confident they didn't tow) and sleeping in 50 degrees vs. 30 was relatively fantastic.

## What I Learned

- Research and context-gathering IS the work right now. Mapping Jeffrey's planning methodology and figuring out how to apply it to the PDF engine is directly productive, even though no code was written.
- The car changes the game. Mobility means optionality — different libraries, extended hours possibilities, better sleep spots.
- Know when to stop. Two nights in a row I've hit the wall. The discipline isn't just in pushing through — it's in recognizing when more screen time is just diminishing returns and sleep is the force multiplier.

*Day 2 of the journey. Still in the research and planning phase. No code yet — and that's by design.*
