## Who I Am

I'm Joe, a 26-year-old who's currently homeless. I have a laptop, a library card, donated AI coding tool passes, and a plan.

## What I'm Doing

I'm building a clean-room, memory-safe PDF renderer and generator in Rust — a language I've never written before — using AI coding agents as my primary development tool.

The entire process is documented publicly: every line of code, every decision, every mistake.

## Why

Every major PDF library in production today is written in C or C++ with decades of security vulnerabilities. There is no fast, safe, modern alternative. I'm building one.

But this is about more than a PDF library. It's a demonstration of what one person can build with AI tools, even with zero resources. If I can ship production-grade systems software from a public library, the ceiling for what's possible with these tools is a lot higher than most people realize.

## The Tools

- **Claude Code** — Primary AI coding agent (donated passes)
- **Claude.ai** — Research, planning, spec writing
- **Gemini via AI Studio** — Code review, second opinions
- **ChatGPT** — Brainstorming, alternative perspectives
- **OBS** — Screen recording everything
